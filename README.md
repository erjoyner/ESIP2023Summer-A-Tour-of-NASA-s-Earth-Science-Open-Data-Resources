# ESIP 2023 Summer Meeting: Opening Doors to Open Science
## A Tour of NASA's Earth Science Open Data Resources
Wednesday, July 19 • 2:00pm - 3:30pm

This hands-on session aims to demystify NASA Earth data, services, and tools for data users who are new to NASA data by providing a tour of the freely and openly available Earth data resources. We will show participants how to navigate NASA's Earthdata website, showcase commonly used data discovery, access, and visualization tools, and highlight how a user can get help with NASA Earth data resources. The instruction and scaffolded/supported practice will offer participants hands on assistance and subject matter expertise to successfully discover, access, and use NASA Earth data resources.
