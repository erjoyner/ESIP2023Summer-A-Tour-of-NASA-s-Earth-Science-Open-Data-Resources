# ESIP 2023 Summer Meeting: Opening Doors to Open Science
## A Tour of NASA's Earth Science Open Data Resources
Wednesday, July 19 • 2:00pm - 3:30pm

This hands-on session aims to demystify NASA Earth data, services, and tools for data users who are new to NASA data by providing a tour of the freely and openly available Earth data resources. We will show participants how to navigate NASA's Earthdata website, showcase commonly used data discovery, access, and visualization tools, and highlight how a user can get help with NASA Earth data resources. The instruction and scaffolded/supported practice will offer participants hands on assistance and subject matter expertise to successfully discover, access, and use NASA Earth data resources.

### Presenters
* Jennifer Brennan: NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Outreach Lead, [email Jennifer](Jennifer.L.Brennan@nasa.gov)
* Elizabeth Joyner: NASA Earth Science Data Systems Program Community Coordinator, [email Elizabeth](Elizabeth.r.joyner@nasa.gov)
* Ross Bagwell: NASA ESDIS Systems Engineer, [email Ross](Ross.Bagwell@nasa.gov)

### Requirement
* (Most important!) Participants need to create an [Earthdata Log-in account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) in advance of the presentation if they don't have one already. Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the event!
* Participants are expected to bring their own laptop and charger.

### Location: 
In-person and Virtual

### Getting help
* For Online Attendees:
** We will use Zoom Chat as our main channels for help. Please use Zoom Chat to post questions, direct Teddie (the Zoom Host) to any questions or to request a breakout room with our In-person host.  We have joining us today: Ross, Elizabeth, and Jennifer who will be tag-teaming the online/in-person host as needed. If there are expert NASA data users in the audience who are willing to help new users, please let us know as it is possible that we could use an extra hand. ;)
* For In-person Attendees:
** Please raise your hand if you have a question. For those who are more comfortable with using a “back channel” to ask questions, please use the Mentimeter Q&A option.
