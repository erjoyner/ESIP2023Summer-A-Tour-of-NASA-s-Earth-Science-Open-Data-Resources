### Questions and Answers: Parking Lot
     * What is the status of Open ET? What is the geographical coverage extent?
          OpenET <https://openetdata.org/> OpenET provides global data at different scales. 
     * What national, publicly-available DEM has the highest resolution?
          OpenDEM, https://www.opendem.info, 30m resolution
     * It looked like on the map in the POWER presentation that thereâ€™s either no use or no data coming from western US. What is the reason for that?
