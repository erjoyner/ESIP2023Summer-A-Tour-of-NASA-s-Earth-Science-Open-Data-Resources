### Questions and Answers: Parking Lot

* What is the status of Open ET? What is the geographical coverage extent?
     [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) OpenET provides global data at different scales. 
* What national, publicly-available DEM has the highest resolution?
     [OpenDEM](https://www.opendem.info), 30m resolution
* It looked like on the map in the POWER presentation that thereâ€™s either no use or no data coming from western US What is the reason for that? The map shows the hits asking for data via the POWER API access. 
* Are there applications that are ready to use by crop consultants etc to make recommendations to farmers? Is there training available in these?
     * See NASA's ARSET Training
          * ARSET - [Satellite Remote Sensing for Agricultural Applications](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training?program_area=16&languages=All&source=All)
     * [Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observations (EO) Indicators](https://cropmonitor.org/tools/agmet/) The Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observations (EO) Indicators bring together a variety of Earth Observation (EO) data products on the sub-national scale, each of which provides valuable insights on in-season crop development and current crop conditions. Combined, the different EO data plots help tell the story of in-season crop conditions through the use of different climate, environmental, and vegetative variables
     * [Global Agriculture Monitoring System (GLAM)](https://glam.nasaharvest.org/)The Global Agriculture Monitoring System (GLAM) is a web-based platform to enable near-real-time monitoring of global croplands, primarily using NASA MODIS satellite data. After years of operational use and valuable feedback from partners, it was time to redesign this system to be faster, more flexible, and to capitalize new datasets coming online and new computing architectures available.
     * [OpenET](https://openetdata.org/) OpenET uses best available science to provide easily accessible satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) for improved water management across the western United States. Using the Data Explorer, users can explore ET data at the field scale for millions of individual fields or at the original quarter-acre resolution of the satellite data.
     * [Crop Monitor Open](https://cropmonitor.org/index.php/cmreports/amis-report/), timely, and science-driven information on crop conditions in support of market transparency and early warning of production shortfalls.
     * [Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA)](https://nassgeo.csiss.gmu.edu/CropCASMA/)is a web-based geospatial application. It is designed to remotely sense geospatial soil moisture and vegetation index data derived from NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) missions to assess U.S. soil moisture condition and crop vegetation conditions.
     * [CropScape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) CropScape is a geospatial data service, which offers advanced tools such as interactive visualization, web-based data dissemination, geospatial queries, and automated data delivery to systems such as Google Earth. It was developed in cooperation with the Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems at George Mason University.
     * [VegScape](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/VegScape/) is a geospatial data service, which offers automated updates of vegetative conditions. It delivers interactive vegetation indices that enable quantification of U.S. crop conditions for exploring, visualizing, querying, and disseminating via interactive maps. It was developed in cooperation with the Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems at George Mason University
     * [CropManage](https://cropmanage.ucanr.edu/) agricultural app	delivers irrigation and fertilizer recommendations to farmers and irrigators. Working with California State University Monterey Bay and the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources Institute, NASA is linking space-based observations, supercomputing resources and CropManage to reduce barriers to information access and increase uptake of data-driven approaches to scheduling irrigation and fertilizer use.
     * [CroplandCROS](https://croplandcros.scinet.usda.gov/)app to explore, derive and compare agricultural commodities and Cropland Data Layers (CDL) within the continental United States. Estimate acreage by defining an area of interest. Export and download data layers and results. See the CroplandCROS Resources section below for downloadable data and additional information.
     * NASA Water Portal interactive catalogs of Water Data Needs and NASA Water-Related Capabilities, as part of our mission to improve how water is managed in the arid western U.S. by getting NASA data, technology, and tools into the hands of water managers and decision makers. The portal serves as a hub for building connections between these catalogs and our partners, including water managers, decision makers, and scientists.
